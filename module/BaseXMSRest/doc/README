The module overrides the default siteaccess in order to have
a custom URL dispatcher:

/<module>/<function>

All parameters are submitted via GET or POST.

This RESTFUL should be a simple wrapper on top of a powerful data API. Because I want to user not to learn a data API and a complete different data API.
Also, it should be easier to implement the RESTFUL API.

The response is pure text or a boolean value - not sure if I need to change that into a json response.
Let's try to use all features of the HTTP response (response codes, headers etc).
